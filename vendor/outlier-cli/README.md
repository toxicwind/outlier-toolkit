# CLI Tools

Service-specific command-line tools designed for AI agents and still practical
for humans at a terminal.

This repo contains small Python CLIs for APIs, browser-backed services, local
apps, and automation targets. The tools are built around predictable command
shapes, JSON-first output, clean stderr/stdout separation, shared auth helpers,
and repo-local agent skill files so an agent can inspect command usage before it
runs anything.

## Why This Exists

AI agents are much more reliable when service operations are exposed as narrow,
documented commands instead of ad-hoc browser clicks or one-off scripts. These
CLIs give agents a stable interface for common service tasks while keeping the
same commands available for direct interactive use.

This is not a collection of unrelated scripts. The repo defines a repeatable
way to build Python CLI tools for agent use. Each tool adapts one service,
application, API, browser workflow, or existing command-line program into a
single predictable command surface that agents can inspect, call, cache, and
verify consistently.

## What's Included

- 83 active CLI packages.
- Repo-local service skills in `_repo/skills/<tool>-cli/`.
- Repo-local framework skills and expert agents for building and maintaining
  the tools.
- Generated `usage.json` command maps for agent command planning.
- Shared auth, cache, profile, browser-session, and output helpers.
- A Keychain-backed secret manager for CLI credentials.
- One install command per tool.

## Quick Start

A fresh clone gives you the source, per-tool agent skills, and generated command
maps. It does not automatically install every CLI command or register those
skills with your agent harness. Do both steps before asking an agent to use a
tool.

### Install a CLI

```bash
git clone <repo-url> cli-tools
cd cli-tools
_repo/_scripts/install-cli-tool.sh <tool-folder>
```

The installer uses `uv tool install --editable`, so install `uv` first if your
machine does not already have it. The installed command must also be on your
shell `PATH`.

Examples:

```bash
_repo/_scripts/install-cli-tool.sh airtable
_repo/_scripts/install-cli-tool.sh amazon
_repo/_scripts/install-cli-tool.sh wordpress
```

Then run the installed command:

```bash
airtable --help
amazon orders list --table
wordpress posts list --limit 5
```

Some tools require service credentials or browser-authenticated profile state
before data commands work. Start with the tool's `auth` commands and the
tool-specific README when authentication is required.

### Set Up Your Agent Harness

Point the agent at this repo's skills before asking it to use a CLI tool. The
portable rule is:

```text
For CLI service operations, load <cli-tools-root>/_repo/skills/<tool>-cli/SKILL.md
and inspect <cli-tools-root>/_repo/skills/<tool>-cli/usage.json before running
the installed CLI command. Run CLI commands through Bash. For CLI-tool lifecycle
work, use <cli-tools-root>/_repo/skills/cli-tool/SKILL.md and the repo-owned
cli-tool-expert agent.
```

Use that rule in the place your harness reads project instructions:

- **Codex:** add it to `AGENTS.md` in this repo, your consuming project, or your
  user-level Codex instructions.
- **Claude Code:** add it to `CLAUDE.md` in this repo, your consuming project,
  or your user-level Claude instructions.
- **Other agent harnesses:** register `<cli-tools-root>/_repo/skills` as a
  skill or knowledge root when supported. If the harness does not support skill
  roots, paste the rule above into its system, developer, or project
  instructions.

Optional repo-owned expert-agent links for harnesses that support custom agents:

```bash
CLI_TOOLS_ROOT="$(pwd)"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.codex/agents" "$HOME/.claude/agents"
ln -sfn "$CLI_TOOLS_ROOT/_repo/agents/cli-tool-expert.toml" \
  "$HOME/.codex/agents/cli-tool-expert.toml"
ln -sfn "$CLI_TOOLS_ROOT/_repo/agents/cli-tool-expert.md" \
  "$HOME/.claude/agents/cli-tool-expert.md"
```

After setup, a good agent workflow is: identify the tool folder, load the
matching `_repo/skills/<tool>-cli/SKILL.md`, inspect `usage.json`, verify the
installed command with `<tool> --help`, authenticate if needed, then run the
requested command.

## Design Principles

- Commands should be predictable and discoverable through `--help`.
- JSON is the default data output for automation and piping.
- Human status messages belong on stderr; stdout stays clean for data.
- Browser-backed tools use shared profile/auth helpers from `cli-tools-shared`.
- API-backed tools use the same profile, cache, auth, and output patterns.
- Credentials belong in the CLI-tools secret manager or tool-owned profile
  state, never in source files.
- Agent-facing usage guidance lives next to the repo in `_repo/skills`.

## Architecture

The repo is organized around a shared CLI framework, not around one-off command
scripts. Each service folder is an installable Python package with a consistent
entry point, command structure, output contract, and runtime state layout.

At a high level, a tool is usually one of these adapters:

- **API adapter:** wraps a public or private HTTP API in stable CLI commands.
- **Browser adapter:** wraps a browser-authenticated workflow behind a CLI.
- **Local app/data adapter:** wraps local app data, SQLite stores, AppleScript,
  or operating-system automation.
- **CLI adapter:** wraps an existing command-line program with a more predictable
  command shape and output contract for agents.

The common parts live in [`cli-tools-shared`](_repo/cli-tools-shared/). Tools
reuse that package for the behaviors agents need to be consistent across
services:

- command app construction and standard command conventions
- JSON-first output and table output for interactive use
- authentication profile layout under `~/.local/share/cli-tools/<tool>`
- shared cache commands and cache behavior
- browser session/profile handling for browser-backed tools
- reusable auth verification and status checks

This means an agent does not need to relearn each integration from scratch. Once
it knows the framework, it can expect familiar command groups such as `auth`,
`cache`, `list`, and `get`, inspect the tool-specific `usage.json`, and then run
the service operation through one predictable interface.

### Caching

Tools that read from APIs or browser-backed service surfaces use a common cache
pattern. Cacheable commands keep network and browser reads repeatable, reduce
unnecessary service calls, and make agent workflows easier to debug. The exact
cache keys and freshness rules are tool-specific, but the operational shape is
consistent: tools expose cache management commands, support fresh reads where
needed, and keep cached data out of stdout unless the command is returning data.

### Browser Automation

Browser-backed tools use the shared browser/profile architecture instead of
custom browser code per service. The shared package owns the common lifecycle:
persistent browser profiles, auth markers, session checks, storage-state
handling, and status verification. Individual tools provide the service-specific
URLs and selectors needed to confirm authentication or collect data.

That separation keeps browser automation predictable for agents: the tool owns
the service workflow, while the shared package owns the browser session and auth
plumbing.

## Public Use Notice

Some tools use official APIs. Others use browser automation, local app data, or
undocumented service surfaces where no public API exists. These integrations are
unofficial, may break when a service changes, and should be used only with
accounts and data you are authorized to access.

## Shared Building Blocks

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`cli-tools-shared`](_repo/cli-tools-shared/) | Shared command, browser-auth, cache, profile, and output helpers used by tool packages. |
| [`secret-manager`](_repo/_secret-manager/) | CLI-tools Keychain helper for credentials that belong to CLI tooling. |
| [`skills`](_repo/skills/) | Agent-facing CLI skill bundles. Each installable tool has a matching `<tool>-cli` skill with command guidance and a `usage.json` command tree. Framework support skills such as `cli-tool` and `cli-tool-secrets` also live here. |
| [`agents`](_repo/agents/) | Repo-owned expert agent definitions for maintaining CLI tools across agent harnesses. |

## Secret Manager

CLI credentials belong in the repo-owned secret manager, not in source files,
checked-in `.env` files, shell history, or general agent instructions. The
helper is backed by a dedicated macOS Keychain file:

```text
~/.local/share/cli-tools/cli-tools.keychain-db
```

The helper script is:

```text
_repo/_secret-manager/secrets.sh
```

Secrets are stored in the `cli-tools` Keychain service namespace. Canonical
names use this format:

```text
<cli-tool>-<type>
```

Use the explicit `--tool` and `--type` form when storing new values so the helper
builds the canonical name:

```bash
printf '%s' "$SECRET_VALUE" | _repo/_secret-manager/secrets.sh set --tool <cli-tool> --type <type>
```

Common operations:

```bash
_repo/_secret-manager/secrets.sh set --tool <cli-tool> --type <type>
_repo/_secret-manager/secrets.sh get <cli-tool>-<type>
_repo/_secret-manager/secrets.sh has <cli-tool>-<type>
_repo/_secret-manager/secrets.sh list
_repo/_secret-manager/secrets.sh delete <cli-tool>-<type>
```

The secret manager is for CLI tool code and CLI-tool skills only. It should not
be used as a general project secret store or by unrelated automation. Tool
profile files may reference secrets with `secret://...` placeholders; the
runtime resolves those through this helper instead of storing sensitive values
in the profile file.

See [`_repo/_secret-manager/README.md`](_repo/_secret-manager/README.md) for
remote-host mode, Keychain access policy, and import/export behavior.

## Agent Skills

This repo includes agent skill bundles for CLI operations under `_repo/skills`.
For a tool folder named `<tool>`, the matching service-operation skill is usually:

```text
_repo/skills/<tool>-cli/SKILL.md
```

Each skill tells an agent when to use the CLI, how to call it, and where to find
the tool's generated `usage.json` command reference. Agents should load the
repo-local skill before running service operations for that CLI. Skill bundles
are documentation and orchestration guidance only; they do not replace the
installable CLI package under `<tool>/`.

Two framework support skills also live in `_repo/skills`:

- `_repo/skills/cli-tool/` is the framework skill for creating, testing,
  updating, removing, and validating CLI tools in this repo.
- `_repo/skills/cli-tool-secrets/` documents the CLI-tools secret-manager
  workflow for reusable CLI credentials.

These support skills intentionally do not map to installable service commands.
They describe how to build and maintain the CLI framework itself.

## Expert Agent

The CLI tool expert agent is repo-owned so it can evolve with the framework
instead of drifting in user-level agent folders:

```text
_repo/agents/cli-tool-expert.toml  # TOML agent format
_repo/agents/cli-tool-expert.md    # Markdown agent format
```

User-level harness folders should symlink to those repo files. That keeps normal
agent invocation working while making the repo the source of truth:

```text
~/.codex/agents/cli-tool-expert.toml -> <cli-tools-root>/_repo/agents/cli-tool-expert.toml
~/.claude/agents/cli-tool-expert.md  -> <cli-tools-root>/_repo/agents/cli-tool-expert.md
```

### `usage.json`

`usage.json` is the structured command map for a CLI. It lets an agent inspect
the tool's command tree without guessing syntax from memory. Before running a
command, the agent should use the matching skill and `usage.json` to confirm:

- available command groups and subcommands
- positional arguments and whether they are required
- options, short aliases, defaults, and value types
- examples from the live CLI help when available
- `usage_instructions` that explain when to use each command and how to combine
  important flags

The file is organized as a root object for the CLI, with nested command groups
and leaf commands. `usage_instructions` should exist at the root, group, and
leaf-command levels when the command needs decision guidance beyond the raw help
text.

### Creating or Refreshing `usage.json`

Create or refresh `usage.json` whenever a CLI is added, command names change,
flags are added or removed, defaults change, or examples in `--help` change.

1. Install the CLI from the repo:

   ```bash
   _repo/_scripts/install-cli-tool.sh <tool-folder>
   ```

2. Read the live command help recursively:

   ```bash
   <tool> --help
   <tool> <group> --help
   <tool> <group> <command> --help
   ```

3. Write the command tree to:

   ```text
   _repo/skills/<tool>-cli/usage.json
   ```

4. Include the command structure, arguments, options, examples, and
   `usage_instructions`. Keep command paths exactly as the CLI exposes them;
   for example, document `auth profiles list`, not a flattened `profiles list`.

5. Update `_repo/skills/<tool>-cli/SKILL.md` if the tool's purpose, major
   command groups, trigger phrases, or required operating rules changed.

6. Verify by checking that every documented command path still appears in live
   help and that the skill references the current `usage.json`.

Most service skills in `_repo/skills` must have a corresponding installable CLI
package. The explicit exceptions are framework support skills that maintain the
repo itself, currently `cli-tool` and `cli-tool-secrets`.

## Operating Standards

These rules are intentionally short here; individual tools keep service-specific details in their own README files.

- Data commands output JSON by default. Do not add redundant `--json` flags.
- `get` commands return the resource object. `list` commands return the resource array.
- stdout is for data only. stderr is for progress, warnings, and confirmations.
- API-backed tools expose `auth login`, `auth status`, and `auth logout` when authentication is required.
- Browser-backed tools should reuse shared browser/profile helpers instead of custom browser lifecycle code.
- Credentials belong in the CLI-tools secret manager or the tool-owned profile/config path, never in source files.

## User Profile Storage

Each tool's user profile folder is `~/.local/share/cli-tools/<tool>`. Non-authentication configuration for the tool lives in `~/.local/share/cli-tools/<tool>/.env`.

Authentication-related data lives under `~/.local/share/cli-tools/<tool>/authentication_profiles/<profile>/`, including the profile `.env`, OAuth tokens, API keys, browser session data, auth markers, and auth-tied cache/state.

## Repository Layout

```text
cli-tools/
  <tool>/                  # one installable CLI package
    pyproject.toml
    <tool>_cli/
    README.md
  _repo/cli-tools-shared/        # shared runtime library
  _repo/_secret-manager/          # credential helper for CLI tooling
  _repo/agents/                   # repo-owned expert agent definitions
    cli-tool-expert.toml
    cli-tool-expert.md
  _repo/skills/                   # agent-facing skill bundles for CLI usage
    cli-tool/
    cli-tool-secrets/
    <tool>-cli/
      SKILL.md
      usage.json
```

## Add or Refresh a Tool

```bash
_repo/_scripts/install-cli-tool.sh <tool-folder>
```

Each tool keeps its own package metadata, README, tests, and matching `_repo/skills/<tool>-cli/` agent skill. Use the shared runtime library for common auth, output, cache, and browser-session behavior.
